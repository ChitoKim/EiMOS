Japanese Mahjong Legacy Stick Scorer

  A Library for legacy scoring system of Japanese mahjong tables.
  Legacy mahjong scorers implement special score sticks containing electrical elements.
  My enquiries clarified that the elements are R / L / C passive components.
  This library measures parallel resistances/capacitances of stack-piled score sticks,
  and convert the values into actual scores of 4 mahjong players

  You make your own system, becuase everything is just a passive element value.
